* they have a pairwise IBD file ('data/gcad.r4.wgs.36361.2022.08.15.pairwise_IBD.txt')
* Diagnosis (they named it DX_harmonized): 
    1 => control
    2 => AD

Sample to subject mapping
* also only keep WGS


# Case control
* looks the same so far

#Family
* for family, we used different threshold for AD
    us: 0, 10 -> controls (No dementia, family reported no AD)   
        1-4 -> cases (Definite AD, Probable AD, Possible AD, Family Reported AD)
        5,9 -> NaN 
        #total:6624, case: 2,519, #control: 4,105
    Lisan: 0: control   
          1-3: Case
          #total: 12858 #case: 1,858 #control: 2,493 #NA 8,507



# ADNI:
* Also diff definition for diagnosis:
  us: AD last visit
      case: 608, control: 958
  Li-San: PrevAD & IncAD != MCI
        - either one of them = 1 => cases
        - if they are both = 0, with no age_MCI_onset and no Age_AD_onset => controls
        - case: 611, control: 430
        ** But there are also 137 cases (out of 611) that have Age_MCI 



## Using their pipeline, without removing any duplicates and NAs in diagnosis, we got 59,799 sample
    - control: 25,840, case: 19,262, NaN: 9,462

 

## Aggregrating with manifest file
    1. Only keep SUBJID (in manifest file) whose Sample ID is found in sample QC file -> 36,361 left (org: 56,863)
        a.k.a only keeping the WGS
        * This result is the same as using "SAMPLE_USE" column to filter out WES (so sampleQC file only have WGS(?))  
    2. Only keep the SUBJID in merged_pheno file that overlaps with sample QC file -> 33,639 left
    


## Deal with duplicates
    1. For the duplciates in case control & family study, keep the ones in family study. (drop 32 in case control)
    2. Drop all samples that has Technical Replicate == 1" from the manifest file. (drop 5 in family base, 1 in case control)

## Add SampleID to merged_pheno
    For those SampleIDs that map to several SUBJID, pick the one that has the lowest "missing" column from QC file
        - 4,501 SampleID has more than 1 SUBJID, (9,033 rows with not 1-1 matching SampleID & SUBJID)
        - remove 4,532 rows
        - leave our merged_pheno back to 33,601  


IBD file should be the same as our kingship file
    - only have Sample ID
    - have 1,599 pair in total after only keeping the pairs with pi_hat> 0.95 (originally 4,816 pairs)
    - After filtering, add SUBJID from manifest file (map with SampleID)
    - Filter the pair that have different SUBJID1 & SUBJID2 but with > .95 pi_hat (513 rows)
    
    



Quick and simple update for the 37k data:
Using their pipeline, they got 32k individuals. Number drops to 26k removing individuals that have NAs in either age or diagnosis.
Whereas using our script, we have 21.5k, which is around 4.5k less.
Things that are processed differently are:
We use different columns for diagnosis in two out of three of the phenotype files (ADNI and ADSP Family Study)
The ways of picking duplicated IDs


Questions

AD_diagnosis:
* why dont they dirctly use AD last visit?
