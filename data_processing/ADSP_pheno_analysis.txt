* they have a pairwise IBD file ('data/gcad.r4.wgs.36361.2022.08.15.pairwise_IBD.txt')
* Diagnosis (they named it DX_harmonized): 
    1 => control
    2 => AD

Sample to subject mapping
* also only keep WGS

#Family
* for family, we used different threshold for AD
    us:  0, 10 -> controls (No dementia, family reported no AD)   
        1-4 -> cases (Definite AD, Probable AD, Possible AD, Family Reported AD)
        5,9 -> NaN 
    them: 0: controls   
          1:3: Cases


# ADNI:
* Also diff definition for diagnosis:
  us: AD last visit
  them: PrevAD & IncAD 
        - either one of them = 1 => cases
        - if they are both = 0, with no age_MCI_onset and no Age_AD_onset => controls

IBD file should be the same as our kingship file
    - only have Sample ID
    - have 1,599 pair in total after only keeping the pairs with pi_hat> 0.95 (originally 4,816 pairs)
    - After filtering, add SUBJID from manifest file



Quick and simple update for the 37k data:
Using their pipeline, they got 32k individuals. Number drops to 26k removing individuals that have NAs in either age or diagnosis.
Whereas using our script, we have 21.5k, which is around 4.5k less.
Things that are processed differently are:
We use different columns for diagnosis in two out of three of the phenotype files (ADNI and ADSP Family Study)
The ways of picking duplicated IDs
They are using two additional files provided by ADSP (which are also available in our repo now)
IBD file (‘/gpfs/commons/groups/knowles_lab/data/ADSP_reguloML/ADSP_vcf/phenotype_file/release_36K/gcad.r4.wgs.36361.2022.08.15.pairwise_IBD.txt')
sample ID QC information (‘gcad.qc.r4.wgs.allchr.36361.GATK.2022.08.15.sample.summary.ALL.txt’)
